# RPM - Reperations Per Minute

**Status:** Active Development | **License:** Apache 2.0 | **Hardware:** ATtiny1614

Hi, i want to build a device that can calculate the resperations per minute in stressfull situations and offload the mental task of tracking time, freeing up mental load to identify each in- and expiration.

      .==============.
     // _____()_____ \\
    ||[10:08:59 AF:12]|| 
    || `------------' ||
    ||                ||
    ||    .--.        ||
    ||   (    )  (O)  ||  
    ||    `--'        ||      
    ||                ||
     \\              //
      `=============='
